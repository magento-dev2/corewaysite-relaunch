    "title": "Why Node.js for Backend Development",
    "content": "Node.js has revolutionized backend development with its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Built on Chrome's V8 engine, Node.js delivers exceptional performance for I/O-intensive applications. Whether you need RESTful APIs, GraphQL servers, microservices, or real-time applications, our Node.js expertise ensures scalable, maintainable solutions. We leverage modern Node.js features including async/await, worker threads, and streams to build backends that handle millions of requests efficiently. With JavaScript on both frontend and backend, we deliver full-stack solutions faster.",
